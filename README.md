# composition-helper's goal
This github repository is for a tool designed to assist in musical composition and to show which chords and chord progressions in the major/ionian and minor/aeolian modes are most commonly used according to Common Practice. 

## How to use
All the code for the tool is included in ```site.html```. Simply run that file and after inputting the information for the composition, use the buttons in each chord box to select chords and see what they best go to.
